RV Link is an open source project. You have two ways to get the hardware.

## Path 1: DIY (Build It Yourself)

This is the fastest way to get started. You order standard parts from Amazon/AliExpress and assemble them.

*   **Cost**: ~$150 - $200
*   **Difficulty**: Medium (requires flashing SD card/NVMe and some assembly)
*   **Guide**: [View the Bill of Materials & Assembly Guide](/getting-started/diy-build/)

## Path 2: Pre-Assembled Unit (Waitlist)

We are gauging interest in a small batch of pre-assembled, "plug-and-play" units. These would be hand-built, tested, and pre-flashed with the latest software.

**Target Specs:**
*   Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB or 8GB)
*   NVMe SSD (Fast storage, no SD card corruption)
*   Isolated CAN HAT
*   Custom 3D Printed Case

**Estimated Price**: ~$300 - $350

### Interested?

I am currently collecting names to see if there is enough demand to order parts for a batch.

**[Email me at ted@rvlink.app](mailto:ted@rvlink.app?subject=RV%20Link%20Interest)** with:
1.  Your RV Year/Make/Model.
2.  If you would want a "Pro" install (we configure it for you) or just the hardware.

*Note: This is not a commitment to buy, just an interest check.*

## Consulting & Custom Installs

If you have a high-end coach and want a "turn-key" system installed and configured for you, I take on a limited number of custom projects.

*   **Remote Commissioning**: I log in remotely and set up your dashboard.
*   **Custom Integration**: Adding non-standard devices (Victron, Lithionics, etc.).
