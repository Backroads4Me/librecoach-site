Building your own hardware isn't for everyone. We are exploring the possibility of offering a **Turn-Key Kit** for those who want the power of LibreCoach without the DIY assembly and software flashing.

If there is enough community interest, we will organize a manufacturing run.

### The Goal: True Plug & Play

The kit is designed to be a "ready-to-mount" hub that gets you up and running in minutes:

- **Premium Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 5 + high-speed NVMe Drive + CAN HAT.
- **Pre-Flashed:** All software installed and pre-configured out of the box.
- **Cables Included:** Includes the necessary RV-C drop cables for your rig.
- **Bench Tested:** Each unit is manually tested to ensure hardware integrity before shipping.

### Estimated Pricing

To maintain high-performance components (like the Pi 5 and NVMe storage) and cover assembly and shipping, we are targeting a price point of **$350 – $400**.
