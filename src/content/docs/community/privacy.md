**Last Updated:** January 28, 2026

At LibreCoach, we believe your motorhome's data belongs to you—not a cloud provider.

## Our Philosophy

- **Local-First:** LibreCoach is designed to run locally on your hardware. Your RV data stays inside your RV.
- **No Tracking:** The LibreCoach software does not track your location, usage habits, or system data.
- **Open Transparency:** Because the code is open-source, you can verify exactly how your data is handled at any time.

## Data We Collect

We intentionally limit data collection to the absolute minimum:

### 1. Interest Checks & Waitlists

If you sign up for updates regarding the **Pre-Assembled Kit**, we collect your **email address**.

- **How we use it:** Strictly to notify you if/when the hardware becomes available.
- **No Sharing:** We do not sell, trade, or share your email address with third parties.

### 2. Website Analytics

This documentation site may collect anonymous, aggregate usage data (such as page views) to help us understand which guides are most useful. This data does not contain personally identifiable information.
