LibreCoach is an open-source project that provides a smart RV system you can extend, adapt, and repair. While it’s currently maintained by a single developer, the goal is to grow a community of contributors who can improve the system, share ideas, and help others get the most out of their RVs.

## Ways to Contribute (No Code Required!)

You don’t need to be a programmer to make a meaningful contribution. Here are some ways you can help:

- **Installation Guides**: Help us document the "gotchas" of physical installations in different RVs.
