LibreCoach is an open-source project that provides a smart RV system you can extend, adapt, and repair. While it’s currently maintained by a single developer, the goal is to grow a community of contributors who can improve the system, share ideas, and help others get the most out of their RVs.

## Ways to Contribute (No Code Required!)

You don’t need to be a programmer to make a meaningful contribution. Here are some ways you can help:

- **Documentation**: Spot typos, clarify confusing steps, or add missing sections.
- **Testing**: Try new releases on your hardware and report issues.
- **Support**: Answer questions in the <a href="https://forum.librecoach.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Forum</a>.
- **Showcases**: Share your dashboard screenshots, automation ideas, and setup tips.

## How You Can Help

### 🚐 RV Enthusiasts

- **Share Your Dashboard**: Show off your layout! Screenshots and explanations of your dashboard help inspire and guide other users.
- **Write Tutorials**: Document your setup, integrations, or automations. Example: “How I integrated Starlink with LibreCoach.”
- **Support Others**: Answer questions in the <a href="https://forum.librecoach.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forum</a>. Your experience is valuable!
- **Port Hunters**: Document where the RV-C port is located on your RV model — helps others locate it more quickly.

### 🛠️ Makers

- **Hardware Compatibility**: Help us build a "Verified Hardware" list. If you've used a specific CAN HAT, sensor, or other device that worked, let us know. Same for any that didn't work!
- **Custom Builds**: Share your unique configurations or experimental solutions to help others with non-standard RVs.
- **Installation Guides**: Help us document the "gotchas" of physical installations in different RVs.

### 👩‍💻 Developers
