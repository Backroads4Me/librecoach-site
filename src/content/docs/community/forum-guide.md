*   **💡 Show & Tell**: Show off your dashboard layouts and hardware installs.
*   **🔧 Hardware Mods**: Custom cases, wiring modifications, and non-standard setups.
*   **🤖 Automation Exchange**: Share your YAML automations and Node-RED flows.
*   **💻 Development**: Technical discussions about the codebase and PRs.
