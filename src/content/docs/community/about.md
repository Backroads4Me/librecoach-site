LibreCoach was born from a simple idea: RV owners deserve smart, customizable systems without being locked into expensive or limited manufacturer software.

Owning a 10+ year old RV made me realize that “smart” features often stop evolving once factory software ages or fails. LibreCoach works with older and newer models alike, giving owners the freedom to experiment, customize, and expand their system over time.

### Why LibreCoach Exists

- **Open Source** – Everything is fully transparent. You can audit, modify, or extend the software to fit your RV and your workflow.
- **Avoid Vendor Lock-In** – Say goodbye to expensive, limited factory panels and apps that stop working after a few years.
- **Customizable & Extensible** – LibreCoach adapts to your RV, whether it’s a 2014 coach or a brand-new model.
- **Tinker-Friendly** – I built this because I enjoy tech and tinkering. LibreCoach is designed for people who like to dig in, experiment, and improve.
- **Community Driven** – My vision is for LibreCoach to grow into a thriving open-source project, with contributions and ideas from RV owners everywhere.

### Built for Anyone Who Loves Their RV

Whether you’re a DIY enthusiast or just enjoy experimenting with tech, LibreCoach gives you additional control, insight, and flexibility. With Home Assistant at its core, you can manage lighting, climate, tanks, power systems, and more from a single, modern platform.

LibreCoach isn’t just software — it’s a platform for experimentation, learning, and sharing, empowering RV owners to make their rig truly their own.

### Who’s Behind LibreCoach

LibreCoach was created by a full-time RVer with a mechanical engineering background and a lifelong habit of taking things apart to see how they work. After years of maintaining and modifying cars, motorcycles, boats, and RVs, that hands-on mindset gradually carried over into a career increasingly focused on software, systems, and applications—where the same instinct to understand, modify, and improve complex systems applied just as well.

Living full-time in my 2014 Foretravel iH-45, I built LibreCoach out of daily use, experimentation, and a desire to bring modern, flexible automation to my RV. What started as a personal project is now open-sourced to invite other RV owners to build, improve, and experiment together.

Today, LibreCoach is developed and used on the road while traveling full-time—often in places where hiking boots and bikes come out after the laptop is closed.
