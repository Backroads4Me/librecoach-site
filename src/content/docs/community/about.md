LibreCoach was born out of a desire for truly smart, locally-controlled, and private RV systems.

Most modern RV control systems are proprietary and cloud-dependent. We believe your home on wheels should function perfectly even when you're off the grid—without a subscription, a constant internet connection, or a tracking pixel.

### Our Goals

- **Local First:** Core functionality is hosted on-device. Your RV shouldn't stop working because the cloud is down.
- **Open Hardware:** Built on accessible, high-quality components like the Raspberry Pi 5.
- **Community Driven:** Open-source software and documentation that anyone can audit, improve, or customize.
