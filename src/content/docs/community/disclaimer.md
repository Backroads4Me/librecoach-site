**LibreCoach is an experimental, open-source project.**

By using this software or following these guides, you acknowledge that:

1.  **Use at Your Own Risk:** Modifying your RV's electrical or communication systems (CAN bus) carries inherent risks. Improper installation can cause system instability, equipment damage, or void manufacturer warranties.
2.  **No Warranty:** The software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
3.  **Not Affiliated:** LibreCoach is an independent project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by any RV manufacturer (e.g., Tiffin, Winnebago, Newmar) or component manufacturer (e.g., Spyder Controls, Firefly Integrations).
4.  **Safety Critical Systems:** LibreCoach is intended for convenience (lights, monitoring) and should **never** be relied upon for safety-critical functions. Always maintain manual backups for essential systems.
