## Take Control of Your RV — On Your Terms

Modern RVs promise “smart” features, but often deliver fragmented systems, outdated touch panels, and proprietary software that stops evolving the moment your rig leaves the lot.

LibreCoach fixes that.

It connects your RV’s built-in control network directly to a modern, open smart-home platform—giving you full visibility, automation, and control without relying on the cloud or locked-down vendor hardware.

## What Is LibreCoach?

LibreCoach bridges your RV’s internal **RV-C control network** with **Home Assistant**, turning your coach into a fully local, customizable smart system.

That means:

- One interface instead of multiple panels
- Real automations instead of basic on/off controls
- Your data stays local
- Your system keeps improving over time

Whether you’re parked off-grid or rolling down the highway, LibreCoach works entirely on your network.
