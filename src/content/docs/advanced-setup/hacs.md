## What is HACS?

**HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)** is a custom integration that gives you access to thousands of community-created integrations, themes, and frontend cards that aren't included in the core Home Assistant installation.

While Home Assistant provides official integrations for major devices, HACS allows the community to fill the gaps, often providing support for new devices, niche hardware, or experimental features long before they make it into the official release.

## Why Use HACS?

- **Frontend Upgrades**: Install beautiful custom dashboards and cards (like <a href="https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mushroom</a>).
- **Custom Integrations**: Connect to devices that don't have official Home Assistant support yet.
- **Easy Updates**: HACS handles downloading updates for these custom components with a single click.
- **Discovery**: Browse and discover new ways to extend your RV's capabilities directly from your dashboard.

## Installation

We don't duplicate the installation instructions here because HACS is actively developed and the process can change.

- Visit the <a href="https://hacs.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official HACS website</a> for more information.

:::note
You will need a GitHub account to set up HACS, as it downloads files directly from GitHub repositories.
