## What is HACS?

**HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)** is a custom integration that gives you access to thousands of community-created integrations, themes, and frontend cards that aren't included in the core Home Assistant installation.

While Home Assistant provides official integrations for major devices, HACS allows the community to fill the gaps, often providing support for new devices, niche hardware, or experimental features long before they make it into the official release.

## Why Use HACS?

- **Frontend Upgrades**: Install beautiful custom dashboards and cards (like Mushroom).
- **Custom Integrations**: Connect to devices that don't have official Home Assistant support yet.
- **Easy Updates**: HACS handles downloading updates for these custom components with a single click.
- **Discovery**: Browse and discover new ways to extend your RV's capabilities directly from your dashboard.

## Installation

We don't duplicate the installation instructions here because HACS is actively developed and the process can change.

1.  Visit the official **[HACS Download & Installation Guide](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download)**.
2.  Follow the instructions for **Home Assistant OS** (since LibreCoach runs on HAOS).
3.  Once installed, HACS will appear as a new tab in your sidebar.

:::note
You will need a GitHub account to set up HACS, as it downloads files directly from GitHub repositories.

## Examples of What You Can Add

Here are just two examples of the powerful enhancements available through HACS that many LibreCoach users love:

### 1. Mushroom Cards

**[Mushroom](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom)** is a collection of cards for your dashboard that look modern, clean, and fit perfectly with the LibreCoach aesthetic. They are easier to configure than standard cards and are designed to be touch-friendly for mobile devices and wall tablets.

- **Why get it?** To build a dashboard that looks like a professional app rather than a list of switches.

### 2. Power Flow Card Plus

**[Power Flow Card Plus](https://github.com/flixlix/power-flow-card-plus)** allows you to visualize your RV’s energy usage in real-time.

- **Why get it?** See exactly where your power is coming from (Solar, Shore, Generator, Battery) and where it's going (Consumer loads, Battery charging). It provides a sleek, animated overview of your electrical system.
