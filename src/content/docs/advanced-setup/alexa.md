## Options

### Nabu Casa (Easiest)

The [Nabu Casa](/advanced-setup/nabu-casa/) cloud service includes native Alexa integration with no additional setup.

### Manual Integration (Free)

Requires more setup but doesn't require a subscription. Uses the `emulated_hue` or `alexa_media_player` integration.
